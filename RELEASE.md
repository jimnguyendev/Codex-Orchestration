# Release process

1. Replace `Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` with the release date.
2. Confirm `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, the changelog, the installed package, and lifecycle fixture all use the same new semantic version. Confirm the payload repository, homepage, marketplace source checks, update examples, and security-reporting URL target `jimnguyendev/Codex-Orchestration`, while the original author and MIT license attribution remain intact. Never publish different plugin behavior under a version already used by another bundle; fix forward with a new version so Codex cannot reuse the old cache identity.
3. For schema 6, confirm schema 5 remains the fork's exact fallback-bearing compatibility shape, schema 6 combines fallback plus Opus, both managed hints carry the matching schema-specific route binding, and setup/disable retain byte-exact CAS with Unix and Windows locking. Run malformed, negative, concurrent-replacement, and platform-lock regression tests before the source-of-truth local release gate:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/preflight.py full
   ```

   Local results are PARTIAL; required hosted checks are authoritative. Behavior fixes require an exact regression test, and every plugin payload change requires a strictly greater semantic version. Security or state changes additionally require a threat model, malformed and negative tests, and a fresh final-tree review attested against the exact head SHA. Any later head change invalidates that review.

4. From a new Desktop task, verify one direct same-provider child route. Record `route accepted`; record `used and confirmed` only if the client exposes effective child model/provider/effort metadata.
5. If Claude Fable 5 is included in the release, verify both supported seat paths from a first-party Claude login: Fable Planner `create_plan`/`revise_plan` with a different Advisor, and Fable Advisor `review_plan` with root planning. Confirm the pinned primary model, exact allowlisted helper set reported by runtime metadata, effort, status, the bounded approval loop, and disable/restore. An unknown helper model is a release failure, not an implicit allowlist expansion.
6. If Claude Opus 5 is included in the release, separately qualify both live seat paths from a first-party Claude login. Run Opus Planner `create_plan` and force a reviewed `PLAN_REVISE` round through `revise_plan` with a distinct Advisor; then run Opus Advisor `review_plan` with root planning. For both paths confirm the pinned `claude-opus-5` primary, the primary-only allowed-runtime-model policy, the configured effort, no tools and no session persistence, `status --require-effective`, the eight-review approval bound, and disable/restore. Any helper or other runtime model is a release failure. This is a manual release qualification; local preflight must never invoke Opus.
7. Merge only after every protected check passes.
8. Create a signed annotated tag named `v<manifest-version>` at the reviewed merge commit.
9. Re-run `python3 scripts/preflight.py full` on the tagged tree, then run `python3 scripts/release_check.py --require-tag` and publish a GitHub release from that tag using the matching changelog section.
10. Upgrade from the previous public version in a clean Codex home, reinstall the plugin, and verify the installed version and skill contents changed before starting a new task. Then verify setup, `status --require-effective`, and disable.

Never move a published release tag. If a release is bad, fix forward with a new version and retain the old tag as provenance.

Before downgrading to a release that predates Planner/state-schema-3 support, run `disable` with the current release. Older versions must fail closed on the unknown state schema rather than guessing how to restore it.
